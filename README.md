# Hive-Fillit
Fillit is a project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.

## Objectives
Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching 
the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have 
to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.

A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your program will take a file as parameter, 
which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible. 
Obviously, your main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially 
growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
You should think carefully about how you will structure your data and how to solve this problem, if you want your 
program answers before the next millenium
